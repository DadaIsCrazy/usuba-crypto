Motivation: cryptographic primitive implementations
 - correctness
 - security
 - performances
-->
<!-- Implementations of cryptographic primitives can be judged on three -->
<!-- criteria: -->

<!--  - **Correctness**: implementations must compute what their -->
<!--    specifications describe. While this is the basic requirement for -->
<!--    any code ever written, it is far from trivial to convince oneself -->
<!--    that a highly optimized assembly hand-tuned code is correct, let -->
<!--    alone prove it [20,21]. -->

<!--  - **Security**¹: implementations must be resilient to some if not all -->
<!--    side-channel attacks. While some side-channels attacks are not -->
<!--    easily implemented on traditional servers (fault-injection, power -->
<!--    analysis, ...), others like timing attacks have been shown to be -->
<!--    very effective [3] and cannot be overlooked. -->

<!--  - **Performances**: cryptography must be as fast as possible in order -->
<!--    to be transparent from the application's perspective. To achieve -->
<!--    high throughputs, cryptographers carefully hand-tune their -->
<!--    implementations, exploiting specific features of the CPU -->
<!--    microarchitectures they target, thus obscuring the behavior of the -->
<!--    programs, sometimes raising doubts about correctness and security. -->

-->

<p>Cryptography, from the Ancient Greek <em>kryptos</em> “hidden” and <em>graphein</em>
“to write”, is the practice of securing a communication by
transforming its content (the <em>plaintext</em>) into an unintelligible text
(the <em>ciphertext</em>), using an algorithm called a <em>cipher</em>, which often
takes as additional input a secret <em>key</em> known only from the persons
encrypting and decrypting the communication. Cryptography has been
used literally for ages: its first known use dates back to ancient
Egypt, in 1900 BCE. Almost 2000 years later, Julius Caesar was
notoriously using cryptography to secure his orders to his generals,
using what would later be known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar
cipher</a>, which consists
in replacing each letter by another one such that the <em>i</em>-th letter of
the alphabet is replaced by the (<em>n</em>+<em>i</em>)-th one (for some fixed <em>n</em>
between 1 and 25). Throughout history, the military would continue to
use cryptography to protect their communications, with the famous
example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma</a>,
used by Nazi Germany during World War II. Nowadays, in our
increasingly digital and ever more connected world, cryptography is
omnipresent, for instance to store sensitive data (<em>eg.</em> passwords,
banking data, …), to secure data transfers over the Internet or more
generally to protect any confidential data. Those different
applications have different requirements, which are met thanks to
various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol"><em>cryptographic
protocols</em></a>
describing how to use certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_primitive"><em>cryptographic
primitives</em></a>
(<em>ie.</em>, basic blocks for cryptography, like ciphers) to secure
communications in a given set of circumstances. Examples of
cryptographic protocols include
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS/SSL</a>, to
secure network communications, or the lower-level
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">IPsec</a>, both using cryptographic
primitives likes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption
Standard</a>
(AES) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant">Chacha20</a>
[29]. Other examples of cryptographic primitives include the now
outdated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">Data Encryption
Standard</a>
(DES), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>

<p>While ciphers became more sophisticated,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis"><em>cryptanalysis</em></a>, the
study of breaking ciphers became more sophisticated as
well. Cryptanalysis focuses on finding algorithmic weaknesses in
cryptographic primitives. For instance, the Caesar cipher, presented
above, is easily broken by trying to shift all letters of the
ciphertext by every possible <em>n</em> (between 1 and 25) until it produces
a text that makes sense. Examples of more advanced attacks include
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related-key_attack">Related-key
attack</a>, which
consist in observing similarities in the ciphertext produced by a
cipher for a given plaintext with different keys, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack">Chosen-plaintext
attack</a>, where
an attacker will have access to a set of plaintext and corresponding
ciphertext and will try to retrieve the key. A cipher will typically
be considered secure if no practical attacks exists, that is, no
attack that can be carried out in a reasonable time (<em>eg.</em> tens of
thousands of years), or set up at a reasonable cost (<em>eg.</em> billions of
dollars). However, even when crytanalysis fails to break a cipher, its
implementation might be vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"><em>side-channel
attacks</em></a>, which
rely on monitoring a cipher execution in order to recover secret
data. A typical example is <em>timing attacks</em>: when a cipher uses a
condition on a secret data, the execution time will vary depending on
this data. For instance, consider the following C code that checks if
a provided password matches an expected password:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">check_password</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">provided</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">expected</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">provided</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">expected</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">provided</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expected</code> start with different characters, then
this function will quickly return 0. However, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">provided</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expected</code> start with the same 10 characters, then this function will
loop ten times (and therefore will take longer) before returning 0,
thus informing an attacker monitoring the execution time of this
function that he has the first characters right. An easy fix to this
issue would be to make this function <em>constant-time</em>, by decorrelating
its execution time from its inputs:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">check_password</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">provided</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">expected</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

            <span class="n">flag</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">flag</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More advanced attacks can be designed, especially on complex
hardwares. For instance, the time needed to read some data from memory
on a modern Intel computer heavily depends on whether those data are
in the caches. An attacker could therefore design a timing attack
based on the cache access pattern, also called <em>cache-timing
attack</em>. Even more sophisticated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_analysis"><em>Power
analysis</em></a> allows an
attacker monitoring the power consumption of a device (using typically
an oscilloscope) to gain knowledge of secret data, possibly while
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection">injecting faults</a> in
the computation (using for instance electromagnetic impulsion, or
lasers) to better control what data is leaked.</p>

<p>Primitive implementations must be manually protected against
side-channel attacks using various techniques. For instance, the
common defense against cache-timing attacks consists in replacing
lookup tables by bitwise instructions. Take the following lookup table
for example:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is indexed by 2 bits (since it has 4 elements) can be computed
by the following code (provided that each bit of the 2-bit input has
been put in a different variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1</code>, and that the 2-bit
output is expected to be in two variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r1</code>):</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">x0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bool</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">r0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bool</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">r1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">r0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">r1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x0</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For instance, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table[1]</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> in binary is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01</code>. Calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table()</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x0 = 0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1 = 1</code> produces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r0 = 1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r1 = 0</code>,
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10</code>, which is binary for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>. Another technique to protect
primitive implementations is <em>boolean masking</em>, which aims at
mitigating Power analysis attacks. It consists in representing each
bit <em>b</em> of secret data by <em>n</em> random bits such that their xor is equal
to the original secret bit: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b = b0 ^ b1 ^ ... ^ bn</code> for each secret
bit <em>b</em>. If <em>n</em> is greater than 2, this is called <em>higher order
boolean masking</em>. Adding this protection to the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table</code>
introduced above would produce the following code:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">table</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">x0</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">r0</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">r1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">r0</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="n">r1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">OR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code> is a function computing a bitwise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or</code> between two masked
data. Already, our initially simple lookup table is becoming quite
complicated, and a developper looking at the code would have a hard
time figuring out what it does. Applying the same techniques to a full
cipher would take a considerable amount of time and produce a much
more complex code. Most -if not all- the times, manually implementing
high-throughput cryptographic primitives, and manually securing
primitives against side-channel attacks are two complicated and
tedious taks, hard to get right, and which tends to obfuscate the
code, thus complicating any further maintenance. Doing both at the
same time is an even harder task, reaching the limits of what one can
do by hand.</p>

<!--
Presentation of Usuba
 - programming language for crypto
 - addresses the 3 points above:
   - high-level -> obviously correct, easy to reason on
   - constant-time + countermeasures -> security
   - high-perf C + intrinsics -> fast
-->

<p>Instead, we propose <strong>Usuba</strong> [5,6,7], a domain-specific programming
language designed to write cryptographic primitives, developed by
Darius Mercadier and (and under the supervision of) Pierre-Evariste
Dagand. Usuba is a high-level programming language, making it easy to
reason on programs (and therefore assert of their correctness). Usuba
is constant-time by construction, thus protecting against cache-timing
attacks, and can automatically insert countermeasures like boolean
masking to protect against power-based side-channels. Finally, Usuba
compiles to high-performance C code, exploiting SIMD extensions of
modern CPUs when available (SSE, AVX, AVX512 on Intel, Neon on ARM,
AltiVec on PowerPC), thus performing on par with hand-tuned code in a
lot of cases, sometimes even better.</p>

<!--
Blockciphers in Usuba
 - blockcipher: n rounds of ``stuffs''
   - blockipher == software circuit
   - usuba: high-level circuits
 - Example: Rectangle \cite{zhang:rectangle}
   - circuit (taken from PLDI slides)
   - Usuba code == straight translation
 - obvious what it does
   + still, explain what each function does
 - 10-15% faster than reference
 - more generic and high-level than reference
-->

<p>A blockcipher is typically defined as <em>n</em> rounds of computation, each
of them doing the same thing, and taking the output of the previous
round as well as (most of the times) a key as input. The number of
round is fixed for a given cipher, and the operations done within a
round are typically bit-permutations, bitwise operations, and
sometimes arithmetic operations. A cipher can therefore be seen as a
stateless circuit. For instance, the Rectangle [13] blockcipher takes
a 64-bit plaintext, and 25 64-bit keys as input, and produces the
ciphertext through 24 rounds, each doing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xor</code>, and calling two
auxiliary functions: SubColumn (a lookup table, which provides
non-linearity), and ShiftRows (a permutation, which provides
diffusion). Rectangle can therefore be represented by the following
circuit:</p>

<p><img src="/usuba-crypto/assets/images/blog/rectangle-circuit.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Usuba aims at providing a way to write an implementation of a cipher
which is as close to the specification (<em>ie.</em> the circuit) as
possible. As such, Rectangle can be straight-forwardly written in
Usuba in just a few lines of code (explanations below):</p>

<pre><code class="language-Usuba">table SubColumn (in:v4) returns (out:v4) {
    6 , 5, 12, 10, 1, 14, 7, 9,
    11, 0, 3 , 13, 8, 15, 4, 2
}

node ShiftRows (input:u16[4]) returns (out:u16[4])
let
    out[0] = input[0];
    out[1] = input[1] &lt;&lt;&lt; 1;
    out[2] = input[2] &lt;&lt;&lt; 12;
    out[3] = input[3] &lt;&lt;&lt; 13
tel

node Rectangle (plain:u16[4],key:u16[26][4])
       returns (cipher:u16[4])
vars round : u16[26][4]
let
    round[0] = plain;
    forall i in [0,24] {
        round[i+1] = ShiftRows(SubColumn(round[i] ^ key[i]))
    }
    cipher = round[25] ^ key[25]
tel
</code></pre>

<p>An introduction to the syntax will be given in a later post, but even
without it, the code should be self explanatory: the main function
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rectangle</code> takes a plaintext as an array of 4 16-bit elements, and a
key as a 2D array, and computes 25 rounds, each calling the functions
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShiftRows</code>, described as 3 left-rotations, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SubColumn</code>, which
computes a lookup in a table. This code is painfully simple, and as
close to the specification as one can be. Yet, it compiles to a C code
which is 10-15% faster than the reference implementation [6], while
being much simpler and more generic, as the latter explicitly uses
vector extensions for specific architectures.</p>

<!--
Constant-time code
 - battle against the compiler
   + compiler may introduce branches (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/pcmodel-long.pdf)
   + Example:
       bool f(bool x, bool y, bool z) {
          return (x & y) | (~x & z);
       }
     produces cmove (it's hard to find doc about cmove constant-time or not (cite Dudect?)).
 - battle against the (micro)architecture
   + Example: constant-time multiplication (https://www.bearssl.org/ctmul.html)
 - Dudect: treat primitive as a blackbox
 - Languages to enforce constant-time:
   + HACL* but too low-level
   + FaCT
 - ( Obtained by construction with bitslicing )
-->

<p>One of the other main benefits of Usuba is that the codes it generates
are constant-time <em>by construction</em>. To write constant-time code with
traditional languages (<em>e.g.</em>, C) is to fight an uphill battle against
compilers [22], which may silently rewrite one’s carefully crafted
program into one vulnerable to timing attacks, and against the
underlying architecture itself [23], whose micro-architectural
features may leak secrets through timing or otherwise. For instance,
the assembly generated by Clang 9.0 for the following C implementation
of a multiplexer:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">bool</span> <span class="nf">mux</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>uses a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmove</code> instruction, which is not known to be constant-time
(even though it seems to be, experimentally). Likewise, some integer
multiplication instructions are known to not be constant-time, causing
library developers to write their own software-level constant-time
implementations of multiplications [25]. The issue is so far-reaching
that tools traditionally applied to hardware evaluation are now used
to analyze software implementations [24], treating the program and its
execution environment as a single black-box and measuring whether its
execution time seems constant with a high enough probablity. Most -if
not all- modern programming languages designed for cryptography have
built-in mechanism to prevent non-constant-time operations. For
instance, HACL* [26] has the notion of <em>secure integers</em> that cannot
be branched on, and forbids the use of non-constant-time operations
like division or modulo. FaCT [27] on the other hand takes the stance
that HACL* is too low-level, and that constant-timeness should be seen
as a compilation problem: it provides high-level abstractions which
are compiled down to constant-time idioms. Adopting yet another
high-level approach, Usuba enforces constant-time by using (in a
transparent manner from the developer’s point-of-vue) a programming
model called <em>bitslicing</em>.</p>

<!--
Bitslicing - overview
 - origin: biham on DES
 - change data representation to maximize parallelism
   -> scales well with SIMD extensions
 - lots of record-breaking software implem uses bitslicing
 - modern ciphers designed with bitslicing in mind
 - tedious to write by hand
   + example: Kwan
 - Automatic bitslicing in Usuba
   + clearer, with better performances
-->

<p>Bitslicing was first introduced by Biham [4] as an implementation
trick to speed up software implementations of DES. Intuitively, the
idea of bitslicing is to represent a <em>n</em>-bit data as 1 bit in <em>n</em>
registers. Each register therefore has 63-bit empty bit remaining (in
the case of 64-bit registers), which can be filled in the same fashion
by other independant data. To manipulate such data, the cipher must be
reduced to bitwise logic operators such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x &amp; y</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x | y</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x ^ y</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~ x</code>. On a 64-bit machine, the bitwise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x &amp; y</code> operation then
effectively works like 64 parallel Boolean conjunctions, each
processing a single bit.  High throughput is thus achieved by
parallelism: 64 instances of the cipher can execute in
parallel. Bitslicing is thus especially good at exploiting vector
extensions of moderns CPUs, which offer large registers (<em>eg.</em> 128-bit
Neon on ARM, 128-bit AltiVec on PowerPC, and more commonly known,
128-bit SSE, 256-bit AVX and 512-bit AVX-512 on Intel). Bitsliced
implementations are constant-time by design: no data-dependent
conditionals nor memory accesses are made (or, in fact, possible at
all). Most record-breaking software implementations of block ciphers
exploit this technique [8,9,10,11], and modern ciphers are now
designed with bitslicing in mind [12,13]. However, bitslicing usually
implies an increase in code complexity, making it hard to write
efficient bitslice code by hand, as can be shown in those few lines of
C code which are part of a DES implementation written by Matthew Kwan
[28]:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/DadaIsCrazy/usuba/blob/master/ciphers/des/kwan/des.c#L788-L1043">full
code</a>
goes on like this for almost 300 lines, while the <a href="https://github.com/DadaIsCrazy/usuba/blob/master/samples/usuba/des.ua#L154-L184">Usuba
equivalent</a>
is just a few lines of codes, very similar to the Rectangle code shown
above. The simplicity offered by Usuba does not come at any
performance cost: both Kwan’s and Usuba’s implementations exhibit
similar performances, and more generally, Usuba usually performs on
par with hand-tuned code.</p>

<!--
m-slicing
 - limitations of bitslicing
 - generalization of bitslicing
 - bitslicing properties still apply: constant time & masking
 - solves issues of bitslicing:
    * lower pressure on registers
    * smaller code size
    * less transposition cost
 - type-directed in Usuba
-->

<p>The bitslicing model can sometimes be too restrictive as it forbids
the use of arithmetic operations, and may fails to provide the
expected performances, due to the high pressures it puts on the
registers. To overcome those issues, and drawing inspiration from
Kasper &amp; Schwabe’s byte-sliced AES [11], we propose a generalization
of bitslicing that we dub <em>m</em>-slicing. <em>m</em>-slicing preserves the
constant-time property of bitslicing, while allowing to use SIMD
packed arithmetic instructions (<em>eg.</em>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vpaddb</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vmuldp</code>), as well as
vector permutations (<em>eg.</em>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vpshufb</code>) to speed up permutations. The
type of slicing is controlled with Usuba’s type-system, thus not
inflicting no increase in code complexity: the same code will be
sliced differently depending on the data’s types.</p>

<!--
Motivate Usuba's usefulness
 - AES dominates on high-end intel
 - embedded devices:
     - no hardware support for AES
     - cannot even use hardware because too heavy
     - use lightweight ciphers -> Usuba comes in
 - new primitives (Chacha, ...) arise on intel
   - example: Google uses Chacha in TLS
   - example: WireGuard uses Chacha
 - automatic protection against side-channel
-->

<p>In an era where almost all high-end CPUs have dedicated hardware to
run AES, making it almost unbeatable by any software implementation of
any cipher, one could wonder whether Usuba actually has a role to play
in modern cryptography. However, a lot of embedded devices do not have
hardware support for AES, and have stringent requirements regarding
code size and power consumption, which AES cannot oblige. For such
devices, lightweight ciphers [14,15,16,17] are being developed as
cheap alternatives to AES, and can benefit from Usuba. Even on
high-end CPUs, other ciphers are starting to compete with AES, like
the Chacha family, used for instance by Google in TLS rather than AES
[18], and more recently chosen by WireGuard over AES that was used by
its predecessor, IPsec [19]. Finally, Usuba can automatically generate
countermeasures against power analysis attacks, which even software
implementations of AES can benefit from [30].</p>

<!--
Conclusion: Usuba
 - high-level language for cryptography
 - generalized mslicing model
 - generate efficient C (+ SIMD) code
 - constant-time by construction
 - additional countermeasures
-->

<p>In a nutshell, Usuba is a a statically-typed vector-based programming
language for specifying block ciphers. Its programming model makes the
description of cryptographic algorithms intuitive while its type
system reconciles the need for abstraction –for code reuse– and
specialization –giving access to architecture-specific features. Using
a generalized model of bitslicing, called <em>m</em>-slicing, Usuba can be
used to express a wide range of cryptographic primitives. Usuba codes
are constant-time by design, and thus immune to cache-timing
attacks. Finally, Usuba can automatically protect primitives against
power-based side-channel attacks using higher-order boolean masking.</p>

<p>¹ Note that we concern ourselves only with implementations of
primitives, and not the primitives themselves. This means in
particular that we do not aspire to protect our implementations
against attacks at the algorithmic level (<em>e.g.</em> Chosen-Plaintext
Attacks [1], Related-Key Attacks [2], …). If a primitive is
vulnerable to such attacks, then so will its implementations be.</p>
